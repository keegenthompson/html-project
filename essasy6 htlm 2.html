           The history of computing

            One may wonder about the history of computing that would lead up to today's computing.
            From 1613 to the 19th century the word computer was used to describe a person who was able to do calculations.
            In which that definition has changed. The new definition of computer is a electronic device that can process data/ binary code received by a program.
            Charles Babbage developed the Difference engine which was the first known automatic computing machine in 1822. Which was able to compute several sets of numbers and produce a hard copy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fifteen years later Babbage proposed the idea of the Analytical Engine,
            which was the first general purpose concept.
            It was never created at that time due to budgets.
            Until 1910 when Babbage's youngest son Henry took the task to complete his dad's idea.
            The year 1937 was when John Atanasoff and Cliffberry invented the very first digital computer.
            This computer used vacuum tubes to compute binary math and boolean logic.
            1971 was the year on the invention of the Kenbak-1 personal computer.

            Intel first took off in 1969 with their very first product the 3101 schottky bipolar random access memory.
            Intel also launched the world's first MOS known as the 1101. Intel had created the 16-bit 80286 microprocessor in the 1982.

            In 1975 the company Microsoft was created. It started when Bill Gates a student at, Harvard, would join Paul Allen to team up.
            To later create the Basic language for the Altair. After seeing an article on the Altair 8800 and contacting MITS and offering to create the language,
            which would later be used in the Altair Basic, which later inspired the creation of Microsoft.

            The company Apple first started up in 1976 and released their first computer the same year. The Apple 1 was Apple's first released personal computer kit.
            It came as a circuit board and required a power supply, case, keyboard, and a display.  The Apple 1 cost customers $666.66 when released. Bill Gates was one of the guys behind the new apple 1.
            Apple 1 wasn't the only computer from the apple company. They would later create the Apple e2. Steve jobs would later become CEO of Apple.

    In 1977 the Atari 2600 was introduced. It was microprocessor based. This Atari came with 2 joystick controllers and 2 paddle controllers.
    This computer thats was able to play roms, which were small factor games.

    In the year 1981 the IBM was created, also code named Acorn. This machine had a 8088 processor and 16kb of memory.
            This machine was created by Bill Lowe and his team. In 1982 the Compaq portable was created  by Compaq. The Compaq was a clone of the IBM.
            The company could not just copy the IBM. That would illegal and would be easily seen by IBM. So Compaq reversed engineered the IBMâ€™s bios and made their own which was really close to the IBM bios.
            Which would perform exactly the same. Compaq would go on to create more versions of their compaq and other computers.

        <p>
            From 1982 to the present date computers would advance yearly. For example the world's first graphics card was introduced, the Nvidia Geforce 256.
            From graphic display to strong, high performance displays. From slow old processors to high performance processors.
            The age of computing is always changing due to the demands all over the world.
            What will the next computer/computing machine be?
